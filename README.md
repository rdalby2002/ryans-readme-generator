## Description

Creating a README.md file for each project can be a hassle. Knowing that, I created this professional README generator. With it, users can produce a high-quality README file in minutes by simply answering a few terminal prompts, rather than going through the tedious process of creating such files unassisted.

## Installation

To install, clone the repository to your local machine through Github, then cd into the Develop directory, and run
```bash
npm i inquirer@8.2.4
```

## Usage

To use, while still in the Develop directory, run 
```bash
node index.js
```
then answer the given prompts. After doing so, you'll be shown a success message and find a high-quality README.md file in the Develop directory, to be used at your discretion. The process for both use and installation are demonstrated in this [demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1japGEYqnkQavYjEKx7TDDtSOTgYEUZRK/view).

## Contributing
